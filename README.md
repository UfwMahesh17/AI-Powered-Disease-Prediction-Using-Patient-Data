# AI-Powered-Disease-Prediction-Using-Patient-Data
Transforming Healthcare with ai powered disease Predictor based on Patients Data

With the increase in lifestyle-related diseases and the vast amount of patient data collected globally, healthcare systems require efficient, fast, and accurate methods for disease prediction. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to error, especially in rural or underserved areas.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered disease predictor using patient data (e.g., symptoms, lab results, demographics) to classify and forecast potential diseases.
